- Questquonmange


This is a sketch that I have written for a friend to showcase to him how is website would look like. He is about to open a cook course business and wanted his customers to have access to the recipes they learned and be able to create automatically a shopping list.

There is a lot of things that still needs to be done:

 - tests have to be finalized 
 - mongo access has to be split in several parts (one for recipes and one for shopping list)
 - mongo connection has to be re-open in case of failure
 - Error handling
 - authentication + APIs access secure
 - some charting of the admin console
 - do not reference directly material icons on googleapi 
 - minify and concatenate css and js in dist mode
 - enable html5 for urls
 - etc...
